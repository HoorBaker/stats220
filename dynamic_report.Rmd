## ANALYSIS ON ADS ENCOUNTERED: 


### Device, Frequency, Platform, and Relevance

This survey was created to analyse the data collected from the online survey. It focuses on the **Device** used to view this ad, the **frequency** of encountering this ad, the **platform** where this ad appeared, and the **relevance** of this ad to the survey taker.

In the following sections, we will inspect aspects of the data collected, to see if any relevant trends or numbers appear to be important.

## Device Used
```{r, echo=FALSE}

device_plot <- ggplot(latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = device_used), fill = "#663300") 
device_plot

```

According to our data, the most commonly *used device* for encountering ads online was a Desktop or laptop.

This finding might be surprising, given that many of us assume we spend a lot of our free time on our phones. However, desktops and laptops are often used for tasks such as work, where we tend to spend large periods of time doing focused work. This explains the higher ad encounter in desktops and laptops.  

While phones are primarily used for more casual browsing, desktops and laptops are used for a more attentive type of work, where we spend a significant amount of time, hence encountering more ads.


## Frequency of encountering this ad


```{r}
number_encountered_plot <- ggplot(latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = number_encountered), fill = "#b33c00")
number_encountered_plot

mini <- min(latest_data$number_encountered, na.rm = TRUE)
maxi <- max(latest_data$number_encountered, na.rm = TRUE)
average <- signif(mean(latest_data$number_encountered, na.rm = TRUE))
sd_encounters <- signif(sd(latest_data$number_encountered, na.rm = TRUE))

paste("Minimum number of ads encountered:", mini)
paste("Maximum number of ads encountered:", maxi)
paste("Average number of ads encountered:", signif(average))
paste("Standard deviation of ads encountered:", signif(sd_encounters))

```

The data analyzed shows that the *frequency* of encountering a specific ad ranges from a minimum of 0 encounters to a maximum of 4 encounters.The average frequency is 1.14286, with a standard deviation of 1.31475. These relatively small numbers showcase that ads are shown infrequently and in a non repetitive way, as an average of around 1 translates that the majority of respondents encounter the add only once. 

These findings prove that the algorithm behind these ads encountered online is not overly aggressive, and prefers choosing diversity in its ads rather than overwhelming the viewer with the same ad. Such an approach aims to maintain user engagement by preventing ad fatigue.Furthermore, these findings highlight the smart strategies used in keeping the audience engagement, hence companies can ensure better results while avoiding audience burnout.

## Platform where this add appeared
```{r}
platform_plot <- ggplot(latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = platform), fill = "#bf4040")
platform_plot
```

The data in this section tells us that generally users spend more time on *websites* engaging with content making them a prime target for ads to capture their attention while they scroll by. Since they spend longer times in websites, ads serve as a good distraction or reminder for certain products.

On the other hand, *mobile apps* and *social media* are focused on shorter interaction, which explain the average count of ads on these platforms. Since interaction is brief on these platforms, companies may need to focus on more engaging, brief content to capture attention before users scroll by.

Finally, *search engines* have a significantly lower count than all the other platforms. This can be explained by the relevance of the ads displayed, as they are specific to what has been searched, hence making it a lot more relevant to the user. This makes the ad count a lot less, as a smaller amount of diversity is needed.


## Relevance of ads encountered


```{r}
relevance_plot <- ggplot(latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = relevance), fill = "#660022")
relevance_plot
```


From the **relevance** plot shown above, we can see that a significant number of ads displayed are considered relevant to the viewer. This can be explained by the ad-targeting algorithms that are designed to tailor advertisements based on users specific interests. 

However, the small portion of ads categorized as *No* or *Somewhat* may be explained by the concept of sponsored content. Some companies prioritize reach over relevance, paying for a broader ad distribution rather than relying solely on targeted advertisement.
